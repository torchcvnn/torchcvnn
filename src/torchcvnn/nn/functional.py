    r"""Forward method for MultiHeadAttention.

    This function is adapted from pytorch torch.nn.functional.multi_head_attention_forward

    See :class:`torchcvnn.nn.MultiheadAttention` for details.

    Args:
        query, key, value: map a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output.
            See "Attention Is All You Need" for more details.
        embed_dim_to_check: total dimension of the model.
        num_heads: parallel attention heads.
        in_proj_weight, in_proj_bias: input projection weight and bias.
        add_zero_attn: add a new batch of zeros to the key and
                       value sequences at dim=1.
        dropout_p: probability of an element to be zeroed.
        out_proj_weight, out_proj_bias: the output projection weight and bias.
        training: apply dropout if is ``True``.
        need_weights: output attn_output_weights.
            Default: `True`
            Note: `needs_weight` defaults to `True`, but should be set to `False`
            For best performance when attention weights are not needed.
            *Setting needs_weights to `True`
            leads to a significant performance degradation.*
        use_separate_proj_weight: the function accept the proj. weights for query, key,
            and value in different forms. If false, in_proj_weight will be used, which is
            a combination of q_proj_weight, k_proj_weight, v_proj_weight.
        q_proj_weight, k_proj_weight, v_proj_weight, in_proj_bias: input projection weight and bias.
        static_k, static_v: static key and value used for attention operators.
        average_attn_weights: If true, indicates that the returned ``attn_weights`` should be averaged across heads.
            Otherwise, ``attn_weights`` are provided separately per head. Note that this flag only has an effect
            when ``need_weights=True.``. Default: True


    Shape:
        Inputs:
        - query: :math:`(L, E)` or :math:`(L, N, E)` where L is the target sequence length, N is the batch size, E is
          the embedding dimension.
        - key: :math:`(S, E)` or :math:`(S, N, E)`, where S is the source sequence length, N is the batch size, E is
          the embedding dimension.
        - value: :math:`(S, E)` or :math:`(S, N, E)` where S is the source sequence length, N is the batch size, E is
          the embedding dimension.
        - static_k: :math:`(N*num_heads, S, E/num_heads)`, where S is the source sequence length,
          N is the batch size, E is the embedding dimension. E/num_heads is the head dimension.
        - static_v: :math:`(N*num_heads, S, E/num_heads)`, where S is the source sequence length,
          N is the batch size, E is the embedding dimension. E/num_heads is the head dimension.

        Outputs:
        - attn_output: :math:`(L, E)` or :math:`(L, N, E)` where L is the target sequence length, N is the batch size,
          E is the embedding dimension.
        - attn_output_weights: Only returned when ``need_weights=True``. If ``average_attn_weights=True``, returns
          attention weights averaged across heads of shape :math:`(L, S)` when input is unbatched or
          :math:`(N, L, S)`, where :math:`N` is the batch size, :math:`L` is the target sequence length, and
          :math:`S` is the source sequence length. If ``average_attn_weights=False``, returns attention weights per
          head of shape :math:`(num_heads, L, S)` when input is unbatched or :math:`(N, num_heads, L, S)`.
